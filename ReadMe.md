# RealmCrafter: Community Edition

RealmCrafter was a game development engine primarily focused on the creation of MMORPGs (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games). Designed with simplicity in mind, it aimed to provide an accessible platform for game developers of all skill levels to bring their visions of vast, interactive worlds to life. With its user-friendly interface, RealmCrafter allowed users to construct complex game environments, script game mechanics, and manage multiplayer server logistics without the need for deep programming knowledge. Its toolkit included features for character creation, quest design, and an asset library for populating game worlds with objects and NPCs (Non-Player Characters). Despite its ambition to democratize game development, RealmCrafter struggled to keep pace with the rapidly evolving technology and user expectations in the gaming industry, eventually becoming a relic of a bygone era in game development tools.

RealmCrafter: Community Edition is an actively maintained and updated version of the original RealmCrafter game development engine, revitalized by its dedicated community. This edition is focused on improving and extending the capabilities of the original platform to better suit modern MMORPG development needs. It offers a more robust set of tools and features, including enhanced graphics, updated server capabilities, and a more intuitive user interface, all while maintaining the original's emphasis on accessibility for developers of varying skill levels. The Community Edition also fosters a supportive environment for users to share resources, tutorials, and advice, facilitating collaboration and learning within the game development community. Through continuous updates and community-driven development, RealmCrafter: Community Edition remains a relevant and valuable tool for creating expansive, interactive online worlds.

### Developers

If you would like to add to the Community Edition source please feel free to clone or fork the repo. If you would like to push a branch and open a 
pull request to have your modifications included as part of the official source please request to join the [RCCE Contributors](https://github.com/orgs/RydeTec/teams/rcce-contributors) group.

There are lots of things that developers of any level can do to help contribute. Simply adding comments to existing code, updating documentation, small code refactors or entirely new features are all welcome additions. It's always best to start small and increase complexity over time.

#### Strategy

Branch from `develop` and target pull request to `develop`. Releases will be a pull request from `develop` targeting `master`.

#### Scripts

If you are familiar with the scripting language used by RealmCrafter, improvements and additions to [scripts](data\Server Data\Scripts) in the default project are always appreciated.

#### Blitz

If you are familiar with the Blitz programming language you can help make improvements or changes to the RealmCrafter [engine source code](src) itself.

##### Tests

You could also help writing tests in blitz as well. All tests should live under the [src\Tests](src\Tests) folder and you can run all tests by running the `test.bat` script. Tests are run before every git commit locally and must pass for your commit to succeed.

#### C++

If you are familiar with C++ you can help by making improvements or changes to the Blitz runtime [source code](compiler\BlitzForge\src).

### Documentation

The RCCE documentation can be found [here](docs/index.md). It is currently outdated and incomplete. If you would like to contribute to improving the documentation please request to join the [RCCE Contributors](https://github.com/orgs/RydeTec/teams/rcce-contributors) group.
