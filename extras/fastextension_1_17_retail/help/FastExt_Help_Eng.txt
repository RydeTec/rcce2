* MAIN FUNCTION:

InitExt% ()
	The main function of the library. Use this function after Graphics3D.
	Return not zero value, if library successfully initialized.
	Zero value is returned if version of the Blitz3D not 1.98 and not 1.99


DeInitExt% ()
	Use this function for clear of the library before ClearWorld and EndGraphics commands.
	Useful for change video resolution in your program.
	Example of use: FastExt_Example_ChangeResolution.bb




* POSTPROCESS FUNCTIONS:

RenderPostprocess% (flags%=0, x%=0, y%=0, width%=0, height%=0)
	Render postprocess effects for current buffer (BackBuffer or TextureBuffer) with next rules:
		1. Function render all postprocess effects to BackBuffer without any restrictions.
		2. You can render postprocess effects to TextureBuffer for texture created 
		   with flags = 256+FE_RENDER only (exclusive of DepthOfField) !
		3. DepthOfField effect can be rendered in TextureBuffer of the texture, created
		   with flag 256+FE_ZRENDER and having width=GraphicsWidth() and height=GraphicsHeight()
	Use function after RenderWorld only for "DepthOfField" postprocess effect,
	other effects possible to use in any place of your program (certainly after Graphics3D & InitExt functions).
	flags% - one or more postprocess constants combined with "Or" operator:
		FE_DOF = 1
		FE_Glow = 2
		FE_Blur = 4
		FE_Inverse = 8
		FE_Grayscale = 16
		FE_Contrast = 32
		FE_BlurDirectional = 64
		FE_BlurZoom = 128
		FE_BlurSpin = 256
		FE_BlurMotion = 512
		FE_Overlay = 1024
		
		[ As example, for use two effects at the same time (DepthOfField and Glow)
		  use next code: RenderPostprocess FE_DOF Or FE_Glow ]

	Also function can  disable a filtration of textures.
	level% - уровень анизотропии или режим фильтрации текстур
		-2 - disable filtering and mipmapping 
		-1 - disable filtering and use linear mipmapping
		 0 - use standart filtering and mipmapping (like in Blitz3D by default)
		>0 - level of anisotropic filtration (usually use values 1...16),

	Example of use: FastExt_Example_AnisotropyAndLodBias.bb


CreateTexture% (width%, height%, flags%)
	The standard function is with new possibilities. Now you can set new texture flags:

		FE_ExSIZE
			- allows to assign free sizes of the texture, but
			  be attentive as because such textures is not be tilled (repeated), also
			  can't work on very old videocards.

		FE_RENDER
			- create a rendering texture without depth buffer (Z-buffer).
			  You can render to such texture at RenderWorld function or FastImage library.
			  Use SetBuffer function at preparations of the texture to rendering.

			  Attention! If your texture with FE_RENDER flag only - then RenderWorld can't clear this texture,
			  you must use Cls function for clear or set CameraClsMode YourCamera,1,0 !

		FE_ZRENDER
			- create a rendering texture with depth Z-buffer (for render 3D scenes).
			  You can render to such texture at RenderWorld function or FastImage library.
			  Use SetBuffer function at preparations of the texture to rendering.

			  Warning! For delete texture with FE_ZRENDER flag - you must use FreeTexture or DeinitExt function  
			  (before ClearWorld and EndGraphics), if you change video resolution in your code.
			  This required for removing the depth Z-buffer joined to this texture.

			  Warning! Not use new flags for animated textures (CreateAnimTexture function)!
	
	You can create cubemap textures for rendering - see example file FastExt_Example_RenderCubemap.bb.
	Example of use: FastExt_Example_TextureCreateAndRender.bb and other examples. 


FreeTexture% (texture%)
	Standard function completed for removing the rendering textures.
	Use this function for delete rendering texture, if you change video resolution in your code.

		FE_ALPHAMODULATE - multiply alphas from layers
		FE_BUMP - bump texture (requires one more texture on next layer)
		FE_BUMPLUM - bump texture with luminosity (requires one more texture on next layer)
		FE_PROJECT - texture is displayed as 2D projection (multiply with previous layer)
		FE_PROJECTSMOOTH - texture is displayed as 2D projection (smooth add with previous layer)
		FE_MULTIPLY4X - multiply 4x with previous layer (multiply And 2 bit)
		FE_ADDSIGNED - add signed (add with -0.5 bias, use for detail-texture with lighten and darken details)
		FE_ADDSIGNED2X - add signed 2x (as above but left 1 bit)
		FE_ADDSMOOTH - smooth add (add 2 args, subtract product Arg1 + Arg2 - Arg1*Arg2 = Arg1 + (1-Arg1)*Arg2 )
		FE_SUB - sub this layer from previous layer (Arg1 - Arg2, with no saturation)
		FE_SPECULAR0 - Arg1.RGB + Arg1.A*Arg2.RGB
		FE_SPECULAR1 - Arg1.RGB*Arg2.RGB + Arg1.A
		FE_SPECULAR2 - (1-Arg1.A)*Arg2.RGB + Arg1.RGB

	New flags created from DirectX7 D3DTOP_* constants (see include file: include\FastExt.bb)
	such algorithm (hexademal) $00xxyyzz,
		xx = 1 for 2D project texture (zero - without projection)
		yy - D3DTOP_* color-blend operation constant
		zz - D3DTOP_* alpha-blend operation constant. Zero equal for blitz alpha blend operation (alpha-blend enabled if texture loaded with flag 2. Disabled without flag 2)
	Use TextureBlendCustom function for easy create your texture custom blends (see below).
